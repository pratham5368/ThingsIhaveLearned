Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed".
You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare
their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for
declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign
a value to it.

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name
(age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).

#Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
#Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.

#One Value to Multiple Variables And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


#Unpack a Collection If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. 
#Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
 

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


#Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable

x = "awesome"

  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

print("Python is " + x)

/*C++11 The C++11 standard, also known as C++0x, was officially released in September 2011. It introduced several new language 
features and improvements, including:

1.Auto: Allows compiler to infer the variable type based on its initializing expression.*/

auto integer = 42; // integer is of int type
auto floating = 3.14; // floating is of double type

//2.Range-Based for Loop: Provides foreach-like semantics for iterating through a container or array.

std::vector<int> numbers {1, 2, 3, 4};
for (int number : numbers) {
    std::cout << number << std::endl;
}


//3.Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions that allow the creation of function objects more easily.

auto add = [](int a, int b) -> int { return a + b; };
int sum = add(42, 13); // sum is equal to 55

//4.nullptr: A new keyword to represent null pointers, more type-safe than using a literal ‘0’ or “NULL”.

int *ptr = nullptr;


//5.Thread Support Library: Provides a standard way to work with threads and synchronize data access across threads.

std::thread t([]() { std::cout << "Hello from another thread\n"; });
t.join();



/*C++14 The C++14 standard was officially released in December 2014 as a small extension over C++11, focusing more on fine-tuning 
language features and fixing issues. Some of the new features introduced:*/

//1.Generic Lambdas: Allows lambda function parameters to be declared with ‘auto’ type placeholders.

auto add = [](auto a, auto b) { return a + b; };
auto sum_i = add(42, 13); // Still works with integers
auto sum_f = add(3.14, 2.72); // Now works with doubles too

//2.Binary Literals: Allow you to input integers as binary literals for better readability.

int b = 0b110101; // Decimal value is 53


//3.decltype(auto): Deduces the type of variable to match that of the expression it is initialized with.

auto func = [](auto a, auto b) { return a * b; };
decltype(auto) result = func(5, 3.14); // decltype(auto) deduces to "double"


//4.Variable Templates: Allows you to define variables with template parameters.

template <typename T>
constexpr T pi = T(3.1415926535897932385);
float r = pi<float>; // Instantiated as a float
double d = pi<double>; // Instantiated as a double

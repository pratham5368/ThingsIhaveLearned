/*The non-copyable idiom is a C++ design pattern that prevents objects from being copied or assigned. Itâ€™s usually applied to classes
that manage resources, like file handles or network sockets, where copying the object could cause issues like resource leaks or double
deletions.

To make a class non-copyable, you need to delete the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator. This can be done explicitly
in the class declaration, making it clear to other programmers that copying is not allowed.*/



class NonCopyable {
public:
  NonCopyable() = default;
  ~NonCopyable() = default;

  // Delete the copy constructor
  NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&) = delete;

  // Delete the copy assignment operator
  NonCopyable& operator=(const NonCopyable&) = delete;
};
To use the idiom, simply inherit from the NonCopyable class:

class MyClass : private NonCopyable {
  // MyClass is now non-copyable
};

//1.Classes
/*A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (data members) and behavior (member functions) for a type of object.*/

class Dog {
public:
    std::string name;
    int age;

    void bark() {
        std::cout << name << " barks!" << std::endl;
    }
};
//This Dog class has two data members: name and age, and one member function bark. You can create an object of this class and 
//access its members like this:

Dog myDog;
myDog.name = "Fido";
myDog.age = 3;
myDog.bark(); // Output: Fido barks!


//2.Encapsulation
/*Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and functions that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class.
It helps to hide the internal implementation details of a class and expose only the necessary information and functionalities. 
In C++, you can use access specifiers like public, private, and protected to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.*/

class Dog {
private:
    std::string name;
    int age;

public:
    void setName(std::string n) {
        name = n;
    }

    void setAge(int a) {
        age = a;
    }

    void bark() {
        std::cout << name << " barks!" << std::endl;
    }
};
//In this example, we’ve made the name and age data members private and added public member functions setName and setAge to modify them.
//This way, the internal data of the Dog class is protected and only accessible through the provided functions.

//3.Inheritance
/*Inheritance is the concept of deriving new classes from existing ones, which enables code reusability and organization. In C++,
inheritance is achieved by using a colon : followed by the base class’ access specifier and the base class name. */

class Animal {
public:
    void breathe() {
        std::cout << "I can breathe" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        std::cout << "Dog barks!" << std::endl;
    }
};
//In this example, the Dog class inherits from the Animal class, so the Dog class can access the breathe function from the Animal class.
//When you create a Dog object, you can use both breathe and bark functions.

Dog myDog;
myDog.breathe(); // Output: I can breathe
myDog.bark(); // Output: Dog barks!



//4.Polymorphism
/*Polymorphism allows you to use a single interface to represent different types. In C++, it’s mainly achieved using function overloading,
 virtual functions, and overriding. */

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        std::cout << "The Animal makes a sound" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Dog barks!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Cat meows!" << std::endl;
    }
};
//In this example, we have an Animal base class with a virtual makeSound function. We then derive two classes, Dog and Cat, which 
//override the makeSound function. This enables polymorphic behavior, where an Animal pointer or reference can be used to access 
//the correct makeSound function depending on the derived class type.

Animal *animals[2] = {new Dog, new Cat};
animals[0]->makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks!
animals[1]->makeSound(); // Output: Cat meows!

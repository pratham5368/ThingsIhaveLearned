/*Virtual methods are a key aspect of dynamic polymorphism in C++. They allow subclass methods to override the methods of their base class
 so the appropriate method is called depending on the actual type of an object at runtime.

To declare a method as virtual, simply use the virtual keyword in the methodâ€™s declaration in the base class. This tells the compiler 
that the method should be treated as a virtual method, allowing it to be overridden by derived classes.*/

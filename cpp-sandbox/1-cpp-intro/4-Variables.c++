//In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

/*int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false
Declaring (Creating) Variables*/

//To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:


type variableName = value;

/*Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). 
The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:*/

int myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;



//You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;


//Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10


//A demonstration of other data types:
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)


//Display Variables :--The cout object is used together with the << operator to display variables.
//To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the << operator:

int myAge = 35;
cout << "I am " << myAge << " years old.";


//Add Variables Together:--To add a variable to another variable, you can use the + operator:
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int sum = x + y;
cout << sum;


//To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;



//You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;

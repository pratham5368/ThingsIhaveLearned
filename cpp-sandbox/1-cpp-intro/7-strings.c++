//A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:-Create a variable of type string and assign it a value:

string greeting = "Hello";

//String Concatenation
//The + operator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string.

string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = "Doe";
string fullName = firstName + lastName;
cout << fullName;


string firstName = "John";
string lastName = "Doe";
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

//String Length
//To get the length of a string, use the length() function:

string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
cout << "The length of the txt string is: " << txt.length();

string myString = "Hello";

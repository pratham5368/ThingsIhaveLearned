//cin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (>>).

//In the following example, the user can input a number, which is stored in the variable x. Then we print the value of x:


int x; 
cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter
cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
cout << "Your number is: " << x; // Display the input value



//cout is pronounced "see-out". Used for output, and uses the insertion operator (<<)
//cin is pronounced "see-in". Used for input, and uses the extraction operator (>>)

//C++ Containers are a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) that provide data structures to store and organize data. 
//There are several types of containers, each with its own characteristics and use cases. 

//1. Vector dynamic arrays that can resize themselves as needed. They store elements in a contiguous memory location,
// allowing fast random access using indices.


#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    vec.push_back(6); // Add an element to the end

    std::cout << "Vector contains:";
    for (int x : vec) {
        std::cout << ' ' << x;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}


//2. List is a doubly-linked list that allows elements to be inserted or removed from any position in constant time. It does not
// support random access. Lists are better than vectors for scenarios where you need to insert or remove elements in the middle frequently.


#include <iostream>
#include <list>

int main() {
    std::list<int> lst = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    lst.push_back(6); // Add an element to the end
    
    std::cout << "List contains:";
    for (int x : lst) {
        std::cout << ' ' << x;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}


//3. Map :-associative container that stores key-value pairs. It supports the retrieval of values based on their keys. 
//The keys are sorted in ascending order by default.


#include <iostream>
#include <map>

int main() {
    std::map<std::string, int> m;

    m["one"] = 1;
    m["two"] = 2;

    std::cout << "Map contains:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto &pair : m) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }
}


//4. Unordered_map:-Similar to a map, an unordered map stores key-value pairs, but it is implemented using a hash table. 
//This means unordered_map has faster average-case performance compared to map, since it does not maintain sorted order. 
//However, worst-case performance can be worse than map.


#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> um;

    um["one"] = 1;
    um["two"] = 2;

    std::cout << "Unordered map contains:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto &pair : um) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }
}

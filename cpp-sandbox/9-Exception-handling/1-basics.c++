/*C++ provides a set of keywords and constructs for implementing exception handling:

1.try: Defines a block of code that should be monitored for exceptions.
2.catch: Specifies the type of exception to be caught and the block of code that shall be executed when that exception occurs.
3.throw: Throws an exception that will be caught and handled by the appropriate catch block.
4.noexcept: Specifies a function that doesnâ€™t throw exceptions or terminates the program if an exception is thrown within its scope.*/

//In this example, we define a function divide that throws an exception if b is zero. In the main function, we use a try block to call
//divide and output the result. If an exception is thrown, it is caught inside the catch block, which outputs an error message. This way,
//we can handle the error gracefully rather than letting the program crash when attempting to divide by zero.



//Standard Exceptions
/*C++ provides a standard set of exception classes under the <stdexcept> library which can be used as the exception type for more specific 
error handling. Some of these classes include:

1.std::exception: Base class for all standard exceptions.
2.std::logic_error: Represents errors which can be detected statically by the program.
3.std::runtime_error: Represents errors occurring during the execution of a program.*/

//In this example, we modified the divide function to throw a std::runtime_error instead of a simple string. The catch block now catches

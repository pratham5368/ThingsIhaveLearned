//They return a boolean value i.e., either true (1) or false (0) based on the result of the evaluation.



//1.AND Operator (&&) The AND operator checks if both the operands/conditions are true, then the expression is true.
// If any one of the conditions is false, the whole expression will be false.
//(expression1 && expression2)  Example:

int a = 5, b = 10;
if (a > 0 && b > 0) {
    cout << "Both values are positive." << endl;
}
//2.OR Operator (||) The OR operator checks if either of the operands/conditions are true, then the expression is true. 
//If both the conditions are false, it will be false. (expression1 || expression2) Example:

int a = 5, b = -10;
if (a > 0 || b > 0) {
    cout << "At least one value is positive." << endl;
}
//3.NOT Operator (!) The NOT operator reverses the result of the condition/expression it is applied on. 
//If the condition is true, the NOT operator will make it false and vice versa.

!(expression)
Example:

int a = 5;
if (!(a < 0)) {
    cout << "The value is not negative." << endl;
}
Using these operators, you can create more complex logical expressions, for example:

int a = 5, b = -10, c = 15;

if (a > 0 && (b > 0 || c > 0)) {
    cout << "At least two values are positive." << endl;
}
